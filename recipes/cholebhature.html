    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p> Chole bhature (Hindi: छोले भटूरे) is a food dish popular in the Northern areas of the Indian subcontinent. It is a combination of chana masala (spicy white chickpeas) and bhatura/puri, a fried bread made from maida. Although it is known as a typical Punjabi dish,there are varied claims around the origin of dish.</p>
    <p>Chole bhature is often eaten as a lunch / dinner dish, sometimes accompanied with lassi. It can also be street food or a complete meal and may be accompanied with onions, pickled carrots, green chutney or achaar.</p>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup chickpeas</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup curd</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>First rinse 1 cup white chickpeas a couple of times in water. Then soak them in enough water overnight or for 7 to 8 hours.</li>
        <li>In a 3 litre pressure cooker add the chickpeas. Also add 3 cups water and ¼ teaspoon salt. I have used a pressure cooker but you can also use a pot or pan. The chickpeas will take a lesser time to cook in the pressure cooker than cooking them in a pot. You can also add a pinch or two of baking soda while cooking them. Addition of baking soda is optional.</li>
        <li>Pressure cook chickpeas for 10 to 12 whistles or for about 15 to 20 minutes or till they are tender and cooked well. Once the pressure settles down on its own then open the lid of pressure cooker and check if the chickpeas are cooked well or not. It is important to cook them till they are soft and have a melt in the mouth texture.</li>
    </ol>
