    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p> Pani puri is an immensely popular Indian street food of crispy, hollow, fried dough balls (puri) stuffed with boiled potatoes or steamed moong sprouts or boiled chickpeas or white peas curry (also known as ragda) together with spicy tangy water and a sweet chutney. Pani puri is a favorite chaat snack of many folks and ours too. With so many bursts of tastes and flavors in your mouth when you have pani puri, you just cannot stop from having one ðŸ™‚</p>
    <p> I donâ€™t know who invented pani puri or how it came into existence. It is one of the popular street foods in India. Whereas in Mumbai, we call it pani puri. In the northern states, it is called Golgappa and in Bengal, it is called as Puchka. In Bihar and Jharkand its known as gupchup. Evidently, there are various ways this street food snack is made and enjoyed.</p>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil 2 to 3 medium-sized potatoes. You can boil or steam the potatoes in a pan, instant pot or stovetop pressure cooker adding water as required. When warm, peel them and chop them into small cubes. You can also add some steamed or boiled moong sprouts. Some finely chopped onions can also be added. I have added 1 small-sized finely chopped onion.</li>
        <li>Keep everything ready before you start assembling the pani puri. The potato filling, pooris and the spiced water.</li>
        <li>First crack the top of the puri with a spoon or with your fingers or thumb. Then stuff the potato filling in the puri with a spoon. Add a few teaspoons of sweet chutney or as per your choice. The addition of sweet chutney is optional for the pani recipe shared in this post.</li>
        <li>Then add a few teaspoons of the green spiced water or as per your choice.</li>
    </ol>
