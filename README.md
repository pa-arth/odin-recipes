# odin-recipes
This is a recipe website which uses only HTML 
to present a list of recipes. 
The website consists of an index homepage 
which links to different recipes. 
Sadly, because this is the beginning 
of my programming journey, so I will 
not be using CSS and therefore the UI
may not be the most pleasing. In a later
revision, I will come back and add CSS to make it
look better :)
